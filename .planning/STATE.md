## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Milestone v1]: Software-complete on synthetic data (recorded clips + mock NDI); all 5 phases hardware-free on the dev box
- [Phase 1]: Curated multi-condition clip set + config contract front-loaded as the decisive de-risk
- [Phase 2/3]: Pure-logic brains (scorer, FSM) built and unit-tested in isolation on synthetic streams before YOLO is wired
- [Phase 4]: Model pin yolo26s.pt, dog=16 (verified via model.names); native-ReID BoT-SORT included in v1
- [Phase 5]: Full wiring (NDI mock + orchestrator + OBS + manual score UI) is the integration phase that closes the milestone

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Framing-scorer math (Phase 2) is dense/novel — flagged for `--research-phase` during planning (lead-room, motion-adaptive alpha, conf-norm, size band, zone multiplier)
- [Phase 4]: Native-ReID engagement on yolo26s must be verified at startup (silently downloads a fallback if the head is end2end); COCO dog recall on real footage is unmeasured — measure in Phase 4
